Includes laboratory values (LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose) and therefore allows more accurate determination of coronary risk in men and women aged 35-65 years. Serves as basis for the initiation of lifestyle changes. It should be calculated in all cases before lipid-lowering drugs are prescribed. Is designed for use by physicians and pharmacists..</p>
